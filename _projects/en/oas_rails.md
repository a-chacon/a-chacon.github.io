OasRails is a Rails engine that simplifies API documentation. Inspired by FastAPI's interactive documentation in Python, OasRails automatically generates an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) v3.1 from the application's routes and source code.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Generation**: Creates real-time documentation, without the need for pre-building.
- **Intelligent Automation**: Extracts information directly from the code, including route names, possible responses, and tags.
- **Ease of Use**: Uses code comments for documentation, without the need for additional DSLs.
- **Interactive Interface**: Integrates RapiDoc for a user-friendly experience.

## Advantages

- Reduces errors and accelerates integration for developers.
- Doesn't require learning new DSLs or testing frameworks.
- Automatic documentation updates with each code change.
- Attractive and easy-to-use interface.

## Project Origin

It arose from the need for a Rails documentation tool that was:

1. Easy to use
2. Without additional DSLs
3. With interactive documentation
4. Dynamic and automatically updated

OasRails aims to make the code "self-documenting", simplifying the documentation process for Rails API developers.
