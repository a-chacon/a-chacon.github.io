My previous website was causing complications every time I needed to make graphical modifications, as there was a lot of repeated code, many duplicated pages due to **Polyglot, and features I wanted to renew**. So I started by creating a Jekyll theme based on my website. I also wanted to contribute to the community, so I hope this theme will be useful to others.

## Awesome-jekyll-theme

This is a theme that includes a **clean and minimalist design**, with versatile layout options and consistent navigation. **It's responsive**, adapting well to different devices, and organizes blog content by categories for better site structure.

Just like my website, I built it with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), so some of the code was copy-pasting, but other parts were not. The idea was always to create a theme that **supports multiple languages**, so I built it with Polyglot in mind. However, it's not a requirement to use that functionality. It includes templates for Home, Blog, Post, Projects, and customizable Navbar and Footer.

**There is still work to be done**. I would like to further document the use of the templates, add some microinteractions to make it more dynamic, intuitive, and fun, and provide full support for a dark mode.
