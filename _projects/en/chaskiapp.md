## Motivation

Chaski was born from my frustration with social media and their focus on algorithms that decide what content to show. RSS represents the internet in its most primitive and healthy form, where you control what to read and when. With Chaski, I wanted to create a modern application that makes RSS attractive and easy to use, eliminating the anxiety of quickly consuming information.

## Technology

- High performance and security
- Single codebase for multiple platforms

## Availability

Chaski is available for:

## Future Plans
