**I just wanted to share my experience relearning how to type:**

Most of my time I spend in front of a keyboard, writing code or chatting. But no one ever told me **how I should do it**, I just learned by pressing the corresponding key in the most comfortable way I could. That is, typing only with my **index finger** and **middle finger**, and to a lesser extent my **thumbs**. And that's how I got by for a long time, believing that the faster I moved those fingers, the faster I would type. But the reality is that it only ended up causing me **pain in my forearms**. ðŸ˜…

And the truth is I'm not looking to type faster, I just wanted to type **comfortably** and that's when I found **typing.com**. And I'm not lying to you, I liked it because it's free and has a simple interface. One month practicing 15 minutes a day, it wasn't hard for me to get into the practice because I was going to sit at the PC to program anyway, so I got used to doing the exercise during the first hour of work after our daily meeting.

I went through a moment of **confusion**, where I felt like I didn't know how to type, I tried to do it the new way but it was too slow, it didn't come automatically and I had to keep thinking about which finger to use for certain letters. But **now?** The comfort â€“ I'm writing this post using **all 10 fingers** and everything flows, though sometimes I get confused, especially with the center keys where one index finger crosses over to the other index finger's area and when it comes to using the opposite **Caps Lock** to type a capital letter.

I haven't improved in terms of **speed** either, I'm still around **45â€¯WPM**. But it's just a matter of practice and time (Like everything in life, right?). So if you're looking to perfect or improve something, you can start with something as simple as how you use your keyboard. ðŸ˜Š
