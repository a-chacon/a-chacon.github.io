Translated with <www.DeepL.com/Translator>

The [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database is an open source **object-relational database** system. PostgreSQL has a graphical user interface (GUI) administration control for database administration called [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/). pgAdmin is a design and management interface for the PostgreSQL database. Simple operations, datasheets and databases can be performed with pgAdmin by interacting with the local file system of the database allowed by the user.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) will be the tool that will help us to run these two services easily and quickly, with data persistence. This way we will have an environment ready in a few minutes to continue working.

## Docker compose up: PostgreSQL y pgAdmin

**Requires docker installed**

Create a folder in your project directory and inside it a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yml
services:
  db:
    container_name: pg_container
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: admin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: admin
      POSTGRES_DB: my_db
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin4_container
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    restart: always
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@admin.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:
      - "5050:80"
    volumes:
      - pgadmin-data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  pgdata:
  pgadmin-data:
```

**Update: I removed the version property from the file because it is now deprecated. [ref](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#version-top-level-element-obsolete)**

- [Link](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) to the **full documentation** of the image used for PostgreSQL.
- [Link](https://hub.docker.com/r/dpage/pgadmin4/) to the **full documentation** of the image used for pgAdmin.

Save the changes and then raise the containers with the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

If you want to leave the containers running in the background don't forget the `-d` flag. You will be able to access pgAdmin in your browser at `http://localhost:5050`.

And that's it. **Important**: You can use whatever credentials you want as long as it is a local development environment and do not pretend to use this definition of docker compose in a productive environment.

## Docker Compose Files For development

I just published a repo with all this docker compose files (What I use every day for my apps), so you can easy clone it and raise all the containers you need for develop your apps. Also it is open to contributions:
