## About the Project

CanI is a side project I developed to practice and improve my skills in Ruby on Rails, APIs, and web development. Its goal is simple: to help you decide whether the weather is suitable for outdoor activities.

## How Does It Work?

The app analyzes key weather parameters such as:

- **Temperature**: Is it too cold or too hot for the activity?
- **Humidity**: Will it affect drying or comfort?
- **Wind**: Are there strong gusts that might interfere?
- **UV Index**: Is it safe to be outdoors without protection?
- **Rain**: Will there be precipitation during the activity?

This data is fetched in real-time from the OpenWeather API and processed to provide you with a clear recommendation.

## Technologies Used
