## More About me

I live in Chile. I have been in front of a computer since I was 14 years old, assembling and disassembling things. I like the idea of being able to create, share and learn in a world without borders. And for this I think it is important that knowledge on the internet is for everyone, that our rights, privacy and freedoms are respected, and that there is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fsf.org/" >free software</a>.

I've been working as a web developer since 2018, mostly for startups. I started with the <a target="_blank" href="https://laravel.com/" >Laravel</a> framework and then moved to <a target="_blank" href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. I have done different projects, mostly in API REST format always using best practices, concerned about performance, scalability and code quality. I have been in charge of deploying applications on servers with <a target="_blank" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> distributions on the <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> platform and I have configured one or another continuous deployment with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">Github</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com">Gitlab</a> of small applications.

And I'm not just 0's and 1's. I also like other things like <a href="https://pixelfed.cl/i/portfolio/achacon">photography</a>, road biking and spending time connecting with nature.
