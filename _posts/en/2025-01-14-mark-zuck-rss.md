Just kidding, what he really said is:

> It's time to get back to our roots around free expression.

But, is it really true that he advocates for **freedom of expression**? I don't believe it. Here we already have examples that this freedom of expression is not for everyone:

- [Facebook Deletes Internal Employee Criticism of New Board Member Dana White](https://www.404media.co/facebook-deletes-internal-employee-criticism-of-new-board-member-dana-white/)
- [Meta Is Blocking Links to Decentralized Instagram Competitor Pixelfed](https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/)

In my opinion, this freedom of expression he talks about will only be used to manipulate users' biases by **spreading fake or altered news with political and economic agendas**. We've already seen Musk doing his thing with X (formerly Twitter), and now Zuckerberg is starting to do it publicly and blatantly as well.

But my post isn't entirely about criticizing this decision, there will be others who discuss the ethical, political, and social implications of these centralized social networks in the hands of a few oligarchs. Rather, this post is meant to present you with a **very good alternative** for staying informed with the sources that interest you, without the intervention of third parties (algorithms and companies), a technology that **truly comes from the roots of the internet**: RSS.

### What is RSS?

RSS was born out of the need to consume content that interests you, before the existence of social networks and following several failed attempts to syndicate the web. Essentially, it is a **document** in XML format with a **simple structure where the new entries/articles from the website are included**, and it can be easily read by applications commonly called aggregators or RSS readers.

The application/reader is responsible for checking the RSS file periodically to see if there are new entries, for each feed you follow, and it will display the content. In general, websites want you to visit their webpage directly to read the content, but some readers are also capable of showing you that content right there.

### Benefits

Now that we understand a bit of how it works, we can see the advantages of consuming content this way:

- **No algorithms** involved creating biases and barriers to information on the internet.
- You have control over what to see and what not to see. **You won't be bombarded with ads and dopamine-driven content**.
- **Simple**: this is truly the root of the internet. Not the one Zuckerberg mentions ðŸ¤‘.
- **Decentralized**, no company is monitoring your interactions, preferences, political or religious views.

And if you have or manage a blog or website, the benefits are also evident. You distribute content with little effort and offer an easy access channel to your users/readers.

### Current State

Unfortunately, RSS has lost some popularity, and it's probably not a coincidence. The technology itself **works for end users but not for the interests of big companies**. [Google has a history of helping destroy RSS adoption](https://openrss.org/blog/how-google-helped-destroy-adoption-of-rss-feeds), a clear example of this is the shutdown of Google Reader, a web-based reader.

However, many still use readers to stay updated in their daily lives. Companies like [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com/), and [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) offer web services to follow your sources. On the other hand, there are also open-source projects that you can host yourself, such as [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/), [MiniFlux](https://miniflux.app/), and [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org) that serve to centralize your readings.

In addition to the aforementioned, there are native apps for both Desktop and Mobile that mostly function as clients for these web services and/or work without them. One of these clients is my app [Chaski](https://chaski.a-chacon.com), **a reader that works independently of any server** and with a more **modern and relaxed feel** for consuming the content that matters, without tracking or ads. A simple reader, for which I have several plans for the future if there's genuine interest.

### Conclusion

RSS serves its purpose, it's simple, and helps keep the internet a healthy place and not hijacked by big tech companies. **It would be nice to see RSS make a comeback**, with its adoption growing, and more people joining free and open-source alternatives.

I believe many people already realize that consuming the content pushed by algorithms is no longer viable. These machines are built to make money, not to inform, educate, and keep us connected. If making money means stoking prejudices, implanting ideas, and influencing your decisions, they will do it with true or false information.

I hope Iâ€™ve shared some useful knowledge, contributing to a better internet. Hereâ€™s my app for you. I donâ€™t have a comment system for now, but Iâ€™d love to know if youâ€™re reaching my blog via RSS, if you use it daily, and any feedback on my reader. You can reach out through any of the channels on my main page.

Until next time.
